An AI-Assisted Toolbox  for Quantifying Mineral Transformations: Investigating the Metastability of Amorphous Calcium Carbonate (ACC) with Microfluidics

This GitHub repository houses a specialized toolbox developed to facilitate the quantitative analysis of mineral transformations, with a particular focus on the study of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) metamorphosis. By integrating sophisticated image processing algorithms and deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks employing U-net architecture, this tool automates the analysis of extensive datasets, accurately determining the temporal dynamics of mineral transformations and identifying resultant mineral polymorphs. Although it is tailored to examine the intricacies of ACC transformations, the toolbox's design accommodates a broad spectrum of mineralogical research, offering a robust platform for advancing the scientific understanding of mineral transformation processes.
